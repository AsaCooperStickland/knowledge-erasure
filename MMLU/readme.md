The commands below run Claude models on the MMLU dataset. 
The engine 'claude-v1.3' is the full capacity one, whereas 'claude-instant-v1.0' is the lightweight version.
You can also specify prompt type to either 'single' or 'multiple'. 'single' refers to a group of demonstration questions with answers being supplied as a part of the prompt, whereas 'multiple' refers to having rounds of conversations for demonstration in the prompt.

```bash
cd MMLU
mkdir outputs
API_KEY=<your_api_key>
python run_mmlu_claude.py --anthropic_key=${API_KEY} --engine=claude-v1.3 --prompt_type='multiple'
```
The commands below run Llama models on the MMLU dataset (answer-only setting)
```python
python run_mmlu_llama.py --ckpt_dir [llama-ckpt-dir] --param_size [7/13/33/65]
```
