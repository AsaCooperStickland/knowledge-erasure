# Chain-of-Thought Hub: Measuring LLMs' Reasoning Performance

Recently, there are a lot of progress in LLMs. Many claim that a small model less than 10B can achieve comparible performance to GPT-3.5. Really? 

> In a casual conversation, the distinction between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can be subtle. The difference comes out when **\*the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold\*** â€” GPT-4 is more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions than GPT-3.5.  --  *GPT-4 release blog*

The key differeciator is whether a model can do **complex tasks**, like the old saying: "chit-chat is cheap, show me the reasoning." This is why we compile a list of complex reasoning tasks including math (GSM8K), science (MATH), symbolic (BBH), knowledge (MMLU), to measure which models are really better.

What's different than [HeLM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/)? 
* HeLM uses answer-only prompting, we use chain-of-thought promoting
* HeLM evaluate everything. We only focus on complex reasoning, the key differentiator of LLMs' capability. 

Generally: 
* We rank the model performance by GSM8K, the classical benchmark measuring chain-of-thought math reasoning performance. This is definitly not the only metrics, but a good interpretation is "how good the model can do math while maintaining other generic abilities" -- which is also very hard.
* Still under construction. Code may be a little bit messy. Many missing values. Appologies in advance. 

The MMLU and BBH results
* GPT-4 from its [website](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) and [Bubeck et al Mar 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712)
* \*-davinci-00\* and \*PaLM are from the [Flan-PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416) paper appendix. 
* LLaMA\* from [LLaMA](https://research.facebook.com/publications/llama-open-and-efficient-foundation-language-models/) paper
* Claude is from our own test script, see below about how to run it.

Current results:
* GPT-4 clearly outperforms all other models on GSM8K and MMLU.
* Claude is the only model family that is comparible to GPT family. 
* On GSM8K, gpt-3.5-turbo improves over text-davinci-003. This confirm's OpenAI's Jan 30 2023 release notes "improved mathematical capabilities."
* On MMLU, gpt-3.5-turbo is slightly better than text-davinci-003. But this level of margin is NOT SIGNIFICANT
* Also remember that gpt-3.5-turbo is 10 times cheaper than text-davinci-003
* Also be careful that GPT-4/ 3.5's performance on GSM8K is not true few-shot -- in [GPT-4 report](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf) they said that they mixed a portion of GSM8K training set to train the model
* LLaMA performance on MMLU is from their paper and probably not CoT but AO. Generally on MMLU, AO is better than CoT but just slightly better. So the LLaMA numbers on MMLU might be slightly overestimated.

TODO:
* [ ] Prompt engineering for Claude on MMLU -- currenlty the output of Claude on MMLU looks weird
* [ ] CoT prompt engineering documentation, including 
  * Stable: 
    * complexity based prompting
  * Test: 
    * concise prompting
    * emphasizing important steps 
    * deductive prompting 
    * Single round v.s. multi-round
* [ ] Change the prompt of Claude and gpt-3.5-turbo to be dialog format -- currently it is not dialog format and thus may underestimate the performance
* [ ] More reasoning datasets
  * [ ] Arc-c
  * [ ] Commonsense
  * [ ] Theorem proving 
  * [ ] Coding 
  * [ ] API Call 
* [ ] Draw a figure about model scale v.s. reasoning accuracy 
* [ ] Add Alpaca and Vacuna 
* [x] Add Flan-T5

Why choosing the above tasks? 
* We mostly care about complex reasoning. 
  * Other abilites of LLMs such as summarization or tranlsation are not considered here as they are rather standard and probably not challenging enough. 
* We consider
  * [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416): high school and college knowledge
  * [GSM8K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903): elementary school math. -- Performance improvements on this dataset directly translate to daily math abilities when interacting with LLMs
  * [MATH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14858): very hard math and natural science. All current models struggle. 
  * [BBH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261): a collection of 27 hard reasoning problems

FAQ:
* What are the prompts used in the _complexity-based prompting_ paper?
  * For gsm8k they are: 
    * prompt_hardest.txt
    * prompt_mid.txt 
    * prompt_easy.txt
    * prompt_original.txt
* There are some prompts that have wrong answer
  * Yes, but we keep it as they are used in the original papers
  * Generally the model can be robust under prompt perturbation: even if sometimes there are errors in the prompt, as long as the format of the prompt is about the corresponding task, the model tend to only look at the format, ignore the prompt error, and make its own prediction. 
  * See https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12837 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10001 about more analysis how the model can ignore errors in the prompt
